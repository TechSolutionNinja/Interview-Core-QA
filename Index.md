7. ### Walk me through a recent project you worked on. What was your role, and what was the outcome?

#### LockrEmail – Email Management System

At LockrEmail, I worked as a Full Stack Developer, contributing both on the frontend and backend of the platform.

LockrEmail is an innovative email management system that allows users to sign up with their existing email (e.g., Gmail, Outlook, Hotmail), and the platform generates a new LockrEmail address, such as mykhailo@lockrmail.com, which users can use instead of their original email address.

This helps users manage emails more efficiently, offering a wide array of filters and customization options, such as filtering by date, content, time, sender, and more.

- **My Role:**

  I initially joined the team as a Frontend Developer, responsible for building the company's website using WordPress CMS.

  The website was successfully developed, and my work received positive feedback from the project manager, which led to further responsibilities.

- **Backend Contributions:**

  After delivering solid results on the frontend, I was asked to support the backend development, which was built using Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, and Sequelize ORM.

  Although the backend team was primarily based in the United States, the pace of development was slow, and I stepped in to accelerate it.

  I successfully delivered multiple controllers and played a pivotal role in enhancing backend performance.

  The backend was particularly complex due to the implementation of various customizable email filters.

  My contributions streamlined these filtering mechanisms, ensuring efficient email management for users.

  In this project, I also utilized Postfix, an open-source mail transfer agent (MTA), to handle the sending and receiving of emails, which allowed the platform to manage high email traffic efficiently and securely.

- Frontend Responsibilities:

  For the frontend, I built a pixel-perfect UI using React based on Figma designs, ensuring a responsive and smooth user experience across all devices.

  I also utilized Redux and Redux-Saga to manage application state and handle asynchronous operations, such as loading and processing data.

  I created custom React hooks to enhance code reusability and maintainability, which sped up the development of new features. Additionally, I integrated analytics tools like Google Analytics,
  Facebook Pixel, and Bing to track user interactions and optimize the platform based on real-time data.

- Full Stack Collaboration:

  As a Full Stack Developer, I worked closely with the backend team to integrate the React frontend with the Express.js and PostgreSQL API. The platform was deployed on AWS, where I gained experience with cloud deployment and infrastructure management.

- Key Outcomes

  Successfully delivered both the frontend and backend components of the platform, ensuring high performance and scalability.

  Played a pivotal role in creating an innovative and efficient email management system with advanced filtering and analytics capabilities.

8. ### Can you describe a challenging bug you encountered? How did you debug and resolve it?

#### DeFi Application, position - React, Web3.js developer

One of the most challenging bugs I encountered was during the development of a decentralized finance (DeFi) application. The issue was with the interaction between the frontend (React) and the smart contract (Ethereum-based) — the transactions were failing intermittently, and the frontend was not showing the correct status.

To debug and resolve it, I took the following steps:

Isolated the Problem: I first confirmed that the issue wasn’t with the React code or UI by using console.log and checking transaction status messages from the blockchain. The UI wasn’t receiving the correct response from the contract, even though it seemed to work fine for some transactions.

Checked Smart Contract: I used tools like Hardhat and Remix to interact directly with the contract and confirmed that certain conditions within the contract were not met during some transactions, leading to reverts.

Analyzed Web3 Integration: I then dug into how Web3.js was integrated with the React app. I found that the issue was due to the improper handling of gas limits in the transaction calls. Some functions were not passing the correct gas parameters, which led to transaction failures.

Implemented the Fix: I updated the gas calculation logic on the frontend and made sure to handle contract exceptions gracefully. I also added better error handling and informative UI messages to improve user experience during transaction failures.

Tested Thoroughly: After applying the fix, I used various test cases, including edge cases with different gas limits, to ensure that the problem was fully resolved.

By debugging the smart contract interaction and refining the Web3 integration, I was able to eliminate the intermittent failures, and the application worked reliably across all transaction scenarios.

#### Senior React Developer

One challenging bug I encountered was a performance issue in a React application where certain components were rendering unnecessarily, causing significant delays. The bug was difficult to track down because the application worked fine in development but lagged in production.

To resolve it, I followed a systematic approach:

Reproduced the Issue: I first replicated the problem in a controlled environment, ensuring I could observe the performance drop.

Used Profiling Tools: I used Chrome DevTools and React's Profiler to identify which components were causing the bottleneck. This helped me pinpoint a specific component that was unnecessarily re-rendering.

Isolated the Problem: I reviewed the component’s state and props, noticing that it wasn’t efficiently managing updates. It was using inline functions inside the render method, which caused unnecessary re-renders.

Applied a Fix: I refactored the code to use useCallback and React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders, improving the app's performance significantly.

After implementing the fix, the performance improved drastically, and the app ran smoothly without further issues.

9. ### How do you stay updated on the latest trends and advancements in software engineering?

I make it a priority to stay updated on the latest trends and advancements in software engineering through a combination of continuous learning and active participation in the tech community.

First, I regularly follow industry-leading blogs, forums, and publications like Medium, Hacker News, and Dev.to. These platforms provide valuable insights into emerging technologies, best practices, and case studies.

Second, I invest time in hands-on learning. I experiment with new frameworks, libraries, and tools by working on side projects or contributing to open-source initiatives. This helps me deepen my understanding and assess the practicality of new technologies.

Third, I participate in webinars, conferences, and online courses. For instance, I’ve recently taken courses on [specific technology or framework], which allowed me to stay ahead in [specific domain].

Lastly, networking is key. I actively engage with peers and mentors in the developer community through platforms like GitHub, LinkedIn, and tech meetups. Sharing knowledge and discussing trends often sparks fresh ideas and keeps me inspired.

This balanced approach ensures I’m not just keeping up with the trends but also leveraging them to add value in my work.

10. ### How do you ensure effective communication when working on a remote or distributed team?

I ensure effective communication in remote teams by being clear and concise in all messages, maintaining consistent updates through tools like Slack and Jira, and leveraging platforms like Google Meet, Zoom and Notion for real-time discussions.

I also prioritize asynchronous communication to respect time zones and build trust by understanding my teammates’ working styles. This approach fosters collaboration and minimizes misunderstandings.
